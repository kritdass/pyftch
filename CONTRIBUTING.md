### Making the Pull Request

1. Review the [pull request codes](#pull-request-codes), find out which code your pull request comes under, and adhere to its specific guidelines
2. Mention any and all changes, additions, removals, etc. This includes breaking changes and changes in program structure. Document these in the body of your pull request and the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
3. We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning (only make a patch if you are adding support for a distribution or package manager) and
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages  (all lowercase) as of 1.2.0. Please follow these guidelines in your commits and in your pull request title.
4. Ensure that you are following the [code guidelines](#code-guidelines)
5. Bump the version in `pyproject.toml` and `src/pytch/__main__.py`
6. Remove any files used for testing
7. Make your pull request!

### What should I contribute on?

The best way to find things to contribute on is to go to the [todos](README.md#todos) and find something to work on.

You can also check out our [open issues](https://github.com/kritdass/pytch/issues), which are generally low-hanging fruit for contributions.
